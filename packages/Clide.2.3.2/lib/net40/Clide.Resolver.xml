            <summary>
            Resolves assemblies that are referenced from the calling assembly by 
            looking them up in a specified local directory. This enables side-by-side 
            versioning of locally deployed signed assemblies such as Clide itself.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            This is required in order to optimize the assembly loading behavior 
            for scenarios where multiple plugins or extensions may deploy 
            different versions of the same utility assembly. 
            <para>
            This resolver ensures that assemblies that are resolved in the 
            <see cref="T:System.AppDomain"/> for versions that match the ones deployed 
            in the specified local directory, are loaded from it. 
            </para>
            <para>
            This means that if an older assembly is already loaded in the 
            <see cref="T:System.AppDomain"/>, instead of failing at runtime because 
            of the vesion mismatch (default CLR behavior), the new version 
            deployed in the local directory will be loaded instead, allowing 
            both extensions to coexist even if they use different versions 
            of the same assembly.
            </para>
            <para>
            The combined behavior of the CLR and this local resolver guarantees 
            that each extension will get at least the same version that it 
            was compiled and deployed with, and at most the latest version 
            deployed by any extension. As long as the library is backwards 
            compatible, all extensions will happily coexist.
